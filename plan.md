## Campaign flow

![rs-sketch.jpg](rs_files/rs-sketch.jpg)

when certain conditions are met, the player will have the opportunity to meet the special contact.
The special Contact will then perform an exposition and start offering racing related jobs. This marks the beginning of the early game.
As the player completes jobs and progresses through the campaign, the player will attract the attention of rival crews. The rival crews are specialized in certain racing jobs and completing them will raise their attention.
Once the attention has progressed far enough, the rival crews will start harassing the player, serving as an obstacle to the player.
When the attention reached its maximum, the player will have the opportunity to challenge the leader of the rival crew. The rivals serve as wall which has to be overcome by the player to enter the endgame.

## Rivals

As a racing oriented mod, revolving around speed, capital ships will be excluded as they do not fit in with the theme.
Each rival crew will have its own (theme / design) and occupy a certain racing (***market*** / category) in a similar fashion to NFS carbons crews and NFS pro streets teams.
